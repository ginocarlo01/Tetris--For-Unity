## ✔️ Overview   
This game was developed to study Unity features and Tetris itself, with the goal of understanding how the game works.

The main concept of the game revolves around dropping blocks, each consisting of 4 units with different shapes. When you complete a full line, it is cleared, and you earn a score.

## 🛠 Tools
The only tools used for this project were Unity and Visual Studio for coding. I utilized pre-existing assets for game development.

If you'd like to review the primary code I've created for this game, you can find it in Assets/Scripts.

To explain the game's logic, I also created two PDF files that explain the features, one in English and the other in Portuguese.
